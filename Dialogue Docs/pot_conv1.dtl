Hey Old Man. Can you hear me?
You look like you been around for a while? Been around longer than this house, eh?
These bozos are really harshing our whole green vibe here right, bud?
Maybe we can help them out here and get 'em to like us a bit more? You maybe then they won't cut you down, yah old log.
Try messing around to get their attention.
